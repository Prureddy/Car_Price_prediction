# Car_Price_prediction

  This repository contains code for predicting car prices using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Car Price Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Car_Price_Prediction.git

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook containing the car price prediction code:

cd Car_Price_Prediction
jupyter notebook Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb

4. Run the notebook and see the predictions made using both Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models.

## Description

This project aims to predict car prices based on various features using two different regression models - Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars and their prices. It has features such as Car_Name	Year	Selling_Price	Present_Price	Kms_Driven	Fuel_Type	Seller_Type	Transmission	Owner.

### Notebooks

1. `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for car price prediction using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. It also includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models were trained on the dataset, and their predictions were compared. The performance metrics, such as mean squared error, R-squared, etc., are provided in the notebook.
